Year
Month (1 = Jan, 2 = Feb, 3 = March, etc. )  Total Rainfall (Millimetres)
Most Rainfall in a Day (Millimetres)
Rain days (0.2mm or More) (Number)

Please use NumPy to answer the following questions.
The objective of this task is to familiarize yourself with the operation of NumPy.
(There is no need to incorporate error checking).
