# Tokeniser Problem

"""
Take a text file (uploaded to Moodle) as an input of your program. 
Read its content. Write frequency of the words of the text in a file. 
Use pythonâ€™s dictionary data structure for storing frequencies of the words. 
[hint: consider word as key and frequency of that word as value]
